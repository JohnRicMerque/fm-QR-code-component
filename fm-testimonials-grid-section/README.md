## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge helped me learn implementing grids using Tailwind CSS. I learned key concepts like spanning items, ordering them, and generally just having the liberty to layout items using CSS grid. Furthermore, this has helped me reinforce my learnings on media responsiveness and adapt layout with changing screen sizes.
